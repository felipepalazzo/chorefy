## Development

To run this single page locally, the dependencies should be installed first. In the root folder, run

```
yarn
```

If you don't have yarn globally installed, check instructions [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable).

After that, run

```
yarn start
```

This command is going to start the development server; now open http://localhost:1234/ in your browser.

## Important ðŸš¨

Always run `yarn build` to check if your changes are working before merging to main
